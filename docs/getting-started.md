# Design Guidelines
The Mitratech Design Guide provides the guidelines for creating and maintaining user interfaces consistent with the Mitratech Design principles, design language, and best practices across all Mitratech products. It forms the foundation for the Mitratech Design System, which aims to drive a cohesive and consistent visual identity across Mitratech products, reduce the perception of a disjointed product offering, build trust, and create a global identity for Mitratech.

The guide specifies the branding rules for the logos, color look and feel, typography, iconography, and accessibility. It is to be used by designers, product managers, product owners, and developers as a reference point for the enterprise branding language of Mitrateach.
