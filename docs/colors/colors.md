# Overview
Mitratech’s product suite is color-coded by business unit, delivering a consistent brand experience under each service area while also helping us ensure that we’re evenly-distributing content for each audience. We are committed to complying with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast ratios. To do this, apply primary, secondary (if needed), semantic, and extended colors that support usability by ensuring enough color contrast between elements so that people with some sort of low vision or color blindness can see and use our products.

## Principles

### Cohesiveness
Cohesiveness is essential for our MDS colors, as we are aiming to harmonize all the products across the portfolio products and seamless user experience.

### Reflect brand value
Our color palette reflects our brand’s personality, values, and vision. We achieve this using the brand colors in the infographics and illustrations.

### Accessibility
Accessibility is essential in design, and our color palette should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
